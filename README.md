## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nanda. I'm a full-stack dev based in Vancouver, BC, born and raised in Indonesia. 

I'm a senior @ UBC studying Business and Computer Science, and I'm currently seeking any full-time opportunities in Canada! I'd love to get in touch -> nanda.s@hey.com.

I currently work as a part-time full-stack developer at Tapestry, building tools with Vue, PHP, and WordPress. I also lead engineering at Peko, a startup I started with a few friends last summer ([pekoapp.com](https://pekoapp.com) - check us out! We aim to help reduce food waste through a pretty neat mobile app. Launching Soonâ„¢).
