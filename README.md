## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nanda. I'm a full-stack dev based in Vancouver, BC, born and raised in Indonesia. 

I'm a senior @ UBC studying Business and Computer Science, and I'm currently seeking any full-time opportunities in Canada! I'd love to get in touch -> nanda.s@hey.com.

I currently work as a part-time full-stack developer at Tapestry, building tools with Vue, PHP, and WordPress. I also lead engineering at Peko, a startup I started with a few friends last summer ([pekoapp.com](https://pekoapp.com) - check us out! We aim to help reduce food waste through a pretty neat mobile app. Launching Soonâ„¢).

### Projects

I like to tinker around with various technologies and making things that solve my own little frustrations. Here's some of my favourites:

[playground](https://github.com/narendrasss/playground)<br />
Playground is a visual JavaScript debugger built using React, web workers and a custom babel plugin. Learned a lot about code analysis techniques, ASTs, web workers, and safe code evaluation!

[visualizer](https://github.com/narendrasss/visualizer)<br />
A visualizer for algorithm patterns based off the [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) course. Originally built because I was having a hard time following some of the concepts (and admittedly, wanting an excuse to use [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)). I later improved it to use the babel plugin made in the playground project!

### Blog

Most recently I've been fascinated by interactive articles and blogs (the likes of [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s and [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/)'s), so I started making my own!

The first post is currently a WIP, but here's a [short preview](https://blog.narendras.vercel.app/sliding-window).
